# course-problem-in-Codechef
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
This semester, Chef took 
X courses. Each course has 
Y units and each unit has 
Z chapters in it.

Find the total number of chapters Chef has to study this semester.

## Input Format
The first line will contain 
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers 
,
X,Y, and 
Z.
## Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the total number of chapters Chef has to study this semester.

## Constraints
1<=T<=1000
1<=X,Y,Z<=1000

## Sample 1:
## Input           Output
  1 1 1             1
  2 1 2             4
  1 2 3             6

## Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: There is only 
1
1 course with 
1
1 unit. The unit has 
1
1 chapter. Thus, the total number of chapters is 
1
1.

Test case 
2
2: There are 
2
2 courses with 
1
1 unit each. Thus, there are 
2
2 units. Each unit has 
2
2 chapters. Thus, the total number of chapters is 
4
4.

Test case 
3
3: There is only 
1
1 course with 
2
2 units. Each unit has 
3
3 chapters. Thus, the total number of chapters is 
6
6.
